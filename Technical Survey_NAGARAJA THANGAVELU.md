## Q2. Please respond to the following question.

### What are the specific kind of work you wish to pursue in LINE?

I would like to work on the front end design and would like to work on the new features being incorprated on Line App. 

### Among the apps you are currently using, which ones are you particularly interested in or using frequently? (web/smartphone apps are both acceptible; make sure to provide one frequently used app and what you have learned about in the last one year.)

Youtube

In last one year, I've learned that,
* Double tap on the right side of video fast forward by 10 seconds and tapping more increase the forward timings and vice versa on the left side.
* Clicking on "Library" list us the recent watches videos on horizontal slider.
* Clicking on Bell icon on the subscribed video channel will show us notification when a new video is released by that channel.
* Able to do live chat on live video.
* Change to setting to stream HD only on WiFi



### Among the technologies you are recently interersted in, give us the name of one and the reason it draws your attention (list upto three points).

AngularJS 1.0

1. Easy understandable MVC architechture
2. More faster as it directly modifies the DOM Object
3. Dependecy injection and routing feature.

### Among the projects you have worked on, which one are you  most proud of? What were your tasks in the project, and how did you use your knowledge/skills to come up with the solution?

* Dusty  - A Web tool used to show users the result of their testing using rich responsive interface. Developed using AngularJS, it gets the JSON data from Marklogic server and view the results in pictographic way where the user can view the results.

* I was new to AngularJS when we received this project. I had to learn and implement the project with lesser time. Since, I m quite good with JS and HMTL5, working on AngularJS was so enjoyable for me and I tried to use most the features in the project and finally come up with the best efficient solution.
